## Code associated with weibull model fits and figures for Maillard HFA decomposition study
This repository contains all code to replicate model fits, analyses, and figures associated with *Maillard et al. XXXX. Title*.

This project contains two complementary studies exploring home/away effects on the *Quercus petraea* leaf litter decomposition process. In Experiment 1, leaf litter was reciprocally transplanted between two sites (factorial cross) and harvested at approximately 3-month intervals over a two year period to evaluate the rate of substrate mass loss. In Experiment 2, leaf litter from both sites was decomposed at a single site and harvested at approximately 6-month intervals, and additional micorbial community and decomposition processes were evaluated at each harest point.
